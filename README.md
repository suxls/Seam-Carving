Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing <br/>  
Removes the "least interesting" seam of pixels each time in order to preserve the image's most relavant information. 

- Supports removing seam randomly / vertically / horizontally
- Implements a variation of the Greedy Algorithm to find the "least interesting" seam
- Preserves the information of the previously removed seam to reconstruct the original image
